bitTorrent
==========

A bitTorrent client in Python as my latest creation in HackerSchool.  

Requires three packages (all available via pip install): bencode, bitstring, and requests.
Also uses the standard library modules hashlib, random, socket, and struct.

Currently does not have uploading capabilities, which I realizes makes me a bad, bad Internet denizen.
Rest assured that this is only due to this being a work-in-progress and not because I am a soulless leecher.  

As always, feedback and collaboration are encouraged.
